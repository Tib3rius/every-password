# Every SSN

A searchable list of every SSN, just in case you've forgotten one and need to look it up.

## What is an SSN

Almost one hundred years ago, the U.S. government created the Social Security Number (SSN) for the sole purpose of tracking the earnings histories of workers.

This ultimately was widely considered as a bad move.

## What Can I do with an SSN

If someone obtains your SSN with other PII, they can commit identity theft and credit card fraud (including opening credit card accounts in your name).

## Are SSNs handled securely?

No. They are unnecessarily requested, and improperly stored, including written on the back of napkins and sometimes emails en masse to wrong recipients. 

## How is an SSN formatted

- The first three digits are the area number
- The next two digits are the group number
- The final four digits are the serial number

This changed in 2011 when SSNs started being randomized, regardless of the issuing state.

## This project was forked from Every UUID

This is forked from the really cool project that is [everyuuid.com](https://everyuuid.com) which solved all the hard problems to make this happen.
